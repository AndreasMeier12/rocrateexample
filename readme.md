# RO-Crate example with schema

This is a small example of an ro crate with a RDFS schema expressed in JSON-LD.  
It is intended for discussion purposes, it is not canonical.

To build the RO-Crate, execute `create.sh`.

To check that it can be read in, run `open.py`, this requires the library `rocrate`, it's specified
in requirements.txt.
