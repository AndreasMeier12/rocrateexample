# RO-Crate example with schema

This is a small example of an ro crate with a RDFS schema expressed in JSON-LD.  
It is intended for discussion purposes, it is not canonical.

To build the RO-Crate, execute `ro-crate-metadata-export-test/create.sh` from this directory.

To check that it can be read in, run `ro-crate-metadata-export-test/open.py` from this directory,
this requires the library `rocrate`, it's specified
in requirements.txt.
